# IEEE Database Management System

Welcome to the **IEEE Database Management System**! This project is designed to manage and interact with a database for IEEE-related operations. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or part of the IEEE community, this system will help you manage members, events, publications, and more with ease.

## Project Overview

This project consists of a backend database created using SQL and a user-friendly frontend interface developed with Python and Streamlit. The system supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and provides analytical insights with intuitive dashboards.

### Features:
- **Database Creation**: Set up the entire IEEE database structure effortlessly.
- **Data Insertion**: Populate tables with initial data for testing and demonstration.
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage data dynamically through a simple interface.
- **Analytics and Dashboards**: Visualize key metrics such as member distribution, event participation, and publication trends.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Interactive web application for easy access and management.

## How to Use This Project

### 1. Prerequisites
Before diving in, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.8 or later)
- MySQL (or compatible database management system)
- Required Python libraries (`streamlit`, `mysql-connector-python`, etc.)

### 2. Setting Up the Database
To set up the IEEE database, follow these steps:

1. **Create Tables**:
   - Run the SQL script `create_table.sql` to initialize the database structure.
   - This script creates essential tables such as `Members`, `Events`, `Publications`, etc.

   ```bash
   mysql -u [username] -p < create_table.sql
   ```

2. **Insert Initial Data**:
   - Use the script `insert_table_values.sql` to populate the database with example data.
   - This step provides sample records for testing and validation.

   ```bash
   mysql -u [username] -p < insert_table_values.sql
   ```

### 3. Running the Dashboard
To launch the Streamlit frontend, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the Python Streamlit script:

   ```bash
   streamlit run ieee_dashboard.py
   ```

3. Open the web application in your browser (the URL will be displayed in the terminal).

## Project Components

### SQL Scripts:
- **`create_table.sql`**:
  - Defines the schema for the IEEE database, including all tables and their relationships.
- **`insert_table_values.sql`**:
  - Contains sample data for the tables, enabling quick setup for testing.

### Streamlit Dashboard:
- **`ieee_dashboard.py`**:
  - Python script to run the interactive web application.
  - Allows users to perform CRUD operations and view analytics.

## Tables in the Database

### Members Table:
Stores information about IEEE members, including their membership type and contact details.

### Events Table:
Tracks events organized by IEEE, including event dates, locations, and participants.

### Publications Table:
Manages publications authored by members, including titles, topics, and citation counts.

### Relationships:
- Members can participate in multiple events.
- Members can author multiple publications.
- Events and publications are connected via topics and contributors.

---

## Example Use Cases

1. **Membership Management**:
   - Add, update, or delete member details directly from the dashboard.

2. **Event Participation Insights**:
   - Analyze which events have the highest participation rates.

3. **Publication Trends**:
   - View the most cited publications or active research topics.

## Dependencies

Here are the Python libraries you need to install:

```bash
pip install streamlit mysql-connector-python pandas matplotlib
```

---

## Tips and Tricks

- **Database Connection**:
  Ensure the database connection parameters in `ieee_dashboard.py` match your MySQL server settings.

- **Testing New Queries**:
  Experiment with additional SQL queries directly in MySQL Workbench or the terminal before integrating them into the dashboard.

- **Expanding the Project**:
  Add more tables and relationships to extend the database's capabilities. For example, include sponsorship details or volunteer contributions.

## Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas to make this project even better:
- Add authentication and role-based access.
- Include automated email notifications for event updates.
- Expand analytics with predictive modeling for membership trends.
