## Here are **windowing** and **OLAP** queries specifically tailored for your IEEE Academic Publication Database:

### 1. **Window Function: Rank Authors by Number of Publications**
## Description**: This query ranks authors based on the number of publications they have.
   
   SELECT a.author_name, COUNT(pa.publication_ID) AS num_publications,
   RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(pa.publication_ID) DESC) AS publication_rank
   FROM Authors a
   JOIN Pub_Author pa ON a.author_ID = pa.author_ID
   GROUP BY a.author_name;
   

### 2. Window Function: Running Total of Citations per Author**
## Description: This query calculates the running total of citations per author.

   SELECT a.author_name, c.citation_count,
          SUM(c.citation_count) OVER (PARTITION BY a.author_name ORDER BY p.date_of_publication) AS running_total_citations
   FROM Authors a
   JOIN Pub_Author pa ON a.author_ID = pa.author_ID
   JOIN Publications p ON pa.publication_ID = p.publication_ID
   JOIN Pub_Cite pc ON p.publication_ID = pc.publication_ID
   JOIN Citations c ON pc.citation_ID = c.citation_ID;


### 3. Window Function: Find Top Citations per Author Using ROW_NUMBER**
## Description: This query assigns a row number to each citation per author, identifying the top citation.

   SELECT a.author_name, p.paper_name, c.citation_count,
   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY a.author_name ORDER BY c.citation_count DESC) AS citation_rank
   FROM Authors a
   JOIN Pub_Author pa ON a.author_ID = pa.author_ID
   JOIN Pub_Cite pc ON pa.publication_ID = pc.publication_ID
   JOIN Citations c ON pc.citation_ID = c.citation_ID
   JOIN Publications p ON pa.publication_ID = p.publication_ID
   WHERE citation_rank = 1;
   
   
### 4. OLAP: Grouping Sets for Publications by Year and Conference
## Description: This query uses `GROUPING SETS` to display publication counts by year and by conference, along with subtotals.
   SELECT YEAR(p.date_of_publication) AS pub_year, c.conference_name, COUNT(p.publication_ID) AS publication_count
   FROM Publications p
   JOIN Conferences c ON p.conference_ID = c.conference_ID
   GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (YEAR(p.date_of_publication), c.conference_name);


### 5. OLAP: Rollup of Total Citations by Topic and Author**
## Description: This query shows the total citations per topic and author, including subtotals for each topic and a grand total.

   SELECT t.topic_name, a.author_name, SUM(c.citation_count) AS total_citations
   FROM Topics t
   JOIN Pub_Topic pt ON t.topic_ID = pt.topic_ID
   JOIN Publications p ON pt.publication_ID = p.publication_ID
   JOIN Pub_Author pa ON p.publication_ID = pa.publication_ID
   JOIN Authors a ON pa.author_ID = a.author_ID
   JOIN Pub_Cite pc ON p.publication_ID = pc.publication_ID
   JOIN Citations c ON pc.citation_ID = c.citation_ID
   GROUP BY ROLLUP(t.topic_name, a.author_name);
   

### 6. **OLAP: Cube of Publication Count by Conference and Year**
## Description: This query calculates the publication count for each conference and year, and includes subtotals for all combinations.
   
   SELECT c.conference_name, YEAR(p.date_of_publication) AS pub_year, COUNT(p.publication_ID) AS publication_count
   FROM Publications p
   JOIN Conferences c ON p.conference_ID = c.conference_ID
   GROUP BY CUBE(c.conference_name, YEAR(p.date_of_publication));


### 7. **Window Function: Calculate Percentile Rank of Citations per Publication**
## Description: This query calculates the percentile rank of each publication based on the number of citations it has received.

   SELECT p.paper_name, c.citation_count,
   PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY c.citation_count) AS citation_percentile
   FROM Publications p
   JOIN Pub_Cite pc ON p.publication_ID = pc.publication_ID
   JOIN Citations c ON pc.citation_ID = c.citation_ID;
   

### 8. **Window Function: Lead and Lag to Compare Citations per Year**
## Description: This query uses `LEAD()` and `LAG()` functions to compare the number of citations received by a publication in consecutive years.

   SELECT p.paper_name, YEAR(p.date_of_publication) AS pub_year, c.citation_count,
          LAG(c.citation_count) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(p.date_of_publication)) AS previous_year_citations,
          LEAD(c.citation_count) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(p.date_of_publication)) AS next_year_citations
   FROM Publications p
   JOIN Pub_Cite pc ON p.publication_ID = pc.publication_ID
   JOIN Citations c ON pc.citation_ID = c.citation_ID;
  
  
### 9. **Window Function: Moving Average of Citation Counts for Each Author**
## Description: This query calculates a moving average of the citation counts for each author.

   SELECT a.author_name, p.date_of_publication, c.citation_count,
          AVG(c.citation_count) OVER (PARTITION BY a.author_name ORDER BY p.date_of_publication ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS moving_avg_citations
   FROM Authors a
   JOIN Pub_Author pa ON a.author_ID = pa.author_ID
   JOIN Publications p ON pa.publication_ID = p.publication_ID
   JOIN Pub_Cite pc ON p.publication_ID = pc.publication_ID
   JOIN Citations c ON pc.citation_ID = c.citation_ID;


### 10. **OLAP: Count of Publications per Institution by Year**
## Description: This query counts the number of publications from each institution per year, including subtotals by institution and year.

   SELECT i.inst_name, YEAR(p.date_of_publication) AS pub_year, COUNT(p.publication_ID) AS publication_count
   FROM Institutions i
   JOIN Authors a ON i.institution_ID = a.institution_ID
   JOIN Pub_Author pa ON a.author_ID = pa.author_ID
   JOIN Publications p ON pa.publication_ID = p.publication_ID
   GROUP BY ROLLUP(i.inst_name, YEAR(p.date_of_publication));
